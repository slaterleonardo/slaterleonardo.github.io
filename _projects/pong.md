I made this Pong project as an assignment in my JavaScript class, this was especially fun for me because this was the first time I've ever used the HTML canvas element, which I found surprisingly simple.

The biggest challenge for me during this project was getting the movement of the paddles to feel 'smooth' and 'realistic', I'm satisfied with the results!
